        My name is Michael Bauer, a Software Engineer deeply passionate about
        the art and science of technology. My journey in this ever-evolving
        field is driven by a relentless commitment to excellence and a constant
        pursuit of learning and growth. With each project, I strive to blend
        creativity with functionality, bringing innovative solutions to complex
        problems.

        My expertise spans a broad spectrum, from mastering DevOps practices and
        cloud technologies like AWS and GCP to developing proficiency in diverse
        programming languages such as Python, C#, and Golang. In my role as a
        Tech Lead at Constant Contact, I have had the privilege of steering
        teams towards success in implementing large-scale projects, including
        advanced enterprise architecture and machine learning models. These
        experiences have not only honed my technical skills but have also
        ingrained in me the importance of teamwork, creativity, and
        collaborative success.

        My journey began as a conservatory-trained jazz/classical musician,
        studying at Cincinnati Conservatory and the University of Akron.
        However, a pivotal moment occurred when I decided to delve into the
        world of software engineering entirely on my own. The summer after
        graduating, I acquired the skills necessary to secure a position at my
        first startup. My background in music – with its rich tapestry of
        theory, composition, and improvisation – continues to inspire me in
        approaching problems with a unique perspective. This artistic influence
        is a cornerstone in how I perceive and tackle challenges in the tech
        world, encouraging me to take a spirit of creativity and innovation into
        everything that I do.
