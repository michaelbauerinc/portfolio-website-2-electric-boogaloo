        My name is <span className="text-purple-900">Michael Bauer</span>, a
        dedicated Software Engineer with a deep passion for both the creative
        and technical aspects of technology. My journey in this dynamic field
        has been fueled by a blend of relentless dedication to excellence, a
        thirst to learn, and a sickening work ethic.

        Over the better part of a decade, my skill set has grown to cover a wide
        range, including expertise in DevOps practices, cloud platforms, a
        multitude of programming languages, machine learning models, game
        engines, and more. As an enterprise software engineer, I&apos;ve
        participated and led teams to successfully implement large-scale
        projects, including sophisticated enterprise architectures. These
        experiences have sharpened my technical abilities and underscored the
        value of teamwork, creativity, and shared success.

        My journey started in the world of music, as a jazz/classical musician
        trained at the Cincinnati Conservatory and the University of Akron. A
        turning point came when I shifted my focus to software engineering, a
        path that I had always been insatiably curious about. The summer after
        graduating, I taught myself the necessary skills and landed my first
        startup job. My musical background continues to be a source of creative
        inspiration to this day.
