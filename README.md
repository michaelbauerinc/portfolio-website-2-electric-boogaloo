This is my current portfolio and personal website. It's a next.js app with some neat css tricks and a few phaser games. 

The app is total overkill with some external api call caching, an entire library of common game components, and deployed to kubernetes with an ingress handling tls via a managed cert.

You can run it locally by simply executing the bash script from the root of the repo:

```
bash run.sh
```


And visit localhost:3000 in browser.
